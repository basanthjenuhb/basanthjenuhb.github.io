# Probability - 1. Introduction

Welcome to my first post Probability. This is a series of posts giving you a glimpse of an undergraduate course on Probability and statistics. These posts are are an overview of [Statistics 110: Probability](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110 "20Statistics110:Probability") by Harvard.

Before diving right in, I recommend you to go through the [Math review](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/stat110/files/math_review_handout.pdf "Math Review").
